# VR Public Speaking Stress Prediction using CNNs

This repository contains the code for a specific module within a larger project aimed at developing a VR headset to help individuals manage stress during public speaking.

**Overview of the Wider Project:**

The goal is to create an immersive VR environment that simulates public speaking scenarios. This environment will provide users with opportunities to practice and develop coping mechanisms for speech anxiety. The VR headset will incorporate various features to enhance the experience and provide feedback, including:

* Realistic virtual audiences and environments.
* Tools for practicing different presentation styles.
* Real-time feedback on speech delivery and stress levels.
* Guided exercises for relaxation and confidence building.

**About This Code Repository:**

This specific repository focuses on the **stress prediction component** of the VR headset. It utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to analyse the users speech and predict the speaker's stress level based on the presence and intensity of **Neutral** and **Fear** categories.
